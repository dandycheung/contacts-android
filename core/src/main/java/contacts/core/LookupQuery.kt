/**
 * Uses [android.provider.ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_LOOKUP_URI] to get contacts using
 * lookup keys, which are typically used in shortcuts or other long-term links to contacts.
 *
 * The reason why lookup keys are used as long-term links to contacts is because Contact IDs and the
 * lookup keys themselves may change over time due to linking/unlinking, local contact updates, and
 * syncing adapter operations. Lookup keys provide the ability to retrieve contacts even when its ID
 * or lookup key itself changes.
 *
 * You may use [Query] to get contacts using lookup keys and ids as well but [LookupQuery] is
 * simpler and more robust and optimized for the specific purpose of getting contacts using
 * lookup keys.
 *
 * For a broader, and more AOSP Contacts app like query, use [BroadQuery].
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The [ContactsPermissions.READ_PERMISSION] is assumed to have been granted already in these
 * examples for brevity. If not granted, the query will do nothing and return an empty list.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Here is an example query that returns the contact with the provided `lookupKey`;
 *
 * In Kotlin,
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val contacts = lookupQuery.whereLookupKeyMatches(lookupKey).find()
 * ```
 *
 * In Java,
 *
 * ```java
 * List<Contact> contacts = lookupQuery.whereLookupKeyMatches(lookupKey).find();
 * ```
 *
 * ## Developer notes
 *
 * This query will typically only be used to get a single contact. Therefore, it is really not
 * necessary (nor does it make practical sense) to provide filtering and paginating functions;
 * [accounts], [groups], [orderBy], [limit], [offset], and [forceOffsetAndLimit].
 *
 * However, there may be a user of this API that would want to load contacts from hundreds or
 * thousands of lookup keys. While this practice may violate YAGNI, adding these functions now
 * future-proofs this API and also makes it much similar to the other query APIs;
 * [Query], [BroadQuery], and [PhoneLookupQuery].

     * #### Developer notes
     *
     * So, why not just add these fields to [DataRawContactsFields]?
     *
     * The reason is that [DataRawContactsFields], and everything in [Fields], are used for
     * **Data table** queries. Data table queries uses the
     * [android.provider.ContactsContract.DataColumnsWithJoins], which does not include
     * [android.provider.ContactsContract.SyncColumns] required to determine the
     * [contacts.core.entities.RawContact.account].
     *
     * Furthermore, the display name and options values in the returned rows reference the Contact's
     * values instead of the RawContact's values.
     *
     * Therefore, it made sense to make sure that [RawContactsFields] cannot be a part of a where
     * clause but can be included.
     *
     * ## Including all fields
     *
     * If you want to include all fields, including custom data fields, then passing in an empty

     * **If this supported ordering by Data table fields**, then it would be unable to use the
     * ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET functions of a raw database query and custom ordering via
     * Comparators is required.
     *
     * The Data table uses generic column names (e.g. data1, data2, ...) using the column 'mimetype'
     * to distinguish the type of data in that generic column. For example, the column name of
     * [NameFields.DisplayName] is the same as [AddressFields.FormattedAddress], which is 'data1'.
     * This means that if you order by the display name, you are also ordering by the formatted
     * address and all other columns whose value is 'data1'. This API could work around this
     * limitation by performing the ordering, limiting, and offsetting manually after
     * **all matching** contacts have been retrieved before returning it to the consumer.
     *
     * Note that there is no workaround for the [include] function because the
     * [ContentResolver.query] function only takes in an array of column names. This means that
     * including [NameFields.DisplayName] ('data1') will also result in the inclusion of
     * [AddressFields.FormattedAddress] ('data1').
